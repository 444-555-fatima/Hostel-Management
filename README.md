# Hostel-Management
C# (pronounced "C-sharp") is an object-oriented programming language from Microsoft that aims to combine the computing power of C++ with the programming ease of Visual Basic. C# is based on C++ and contains features similar to those of Java.
C# is designed to work with Microsoft's .Net platform
C# can be used in a window-based, web-based, or console application. To start with, we will create a console application to work with C#.
Here the project is about Window applicatioon forms
A windows form application is an application, which is designed to run on a computer. It will not run on web browser because then it becomes a web application.
A Windows forms application is one that runs on the desktop computer. A Windows forms application will normally have a collection of controls such as labels, textboxes, list boxes, etc.
the Solution will contain the below 2 project files
A Form application called Forms1.cs. This file will contain all of the code for the Windows Form application.
The Main program called Program.cs is default code file which is created when a new application is created in Visual Studio. This code will contain the startup code for the application as a whole.
